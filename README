What's Chopstx?
===============

Chopstx is an RT thread library for ARM Cortex-M3, specifically,
STM32F103.

While most RTOSes come with many features, drivers, and stacks,
Chopstx just offers a RT thread library.

With Chopstx, interrupt handling is also done by a thread.  This
enables coherent code for ease of maintenance.
