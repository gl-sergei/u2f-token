NEWS - Noteworthy changes


* Major changes in Chopstx 1.3

  Released 2017-02-02

** New board support: Blue Pill
It is contributed by Paul Fertser.


* Major changes in Chopstx 1.2

  Released 2016-10-13

** Fix: chopstx_join
chopstx_join is now cancellation point.


* Major changes in Chopstx 1.1

  Released 2016-07-01

** API change: chopstx_poll
In version 1.0, chopstx_poll has variable arguments.  It found that
it's challenging for ffi or lower level C implementation, if C
compiler is new for the specific MCU target.  Another example is that
a program touches FPU registers for varargs, even if no argument is
float.  So, we decided to avoid use of varargs in Chopstx.

** API change: chopstx_setpriority
In version 1.0, chopstx_setpriority does not return value.  It is
changed to return old value of the priority.


* Major changes in Chopstx 1.0

  Released 2016-06-16

** New USB API
Now, USB driver is included in Chopstx.  So, it should be good one.
It used to be the code which was derived from interrupt driven API
with callbacks.  It's changed to event driven API, so that a user can
do as wish, beyond the restriction of callbacks.

** New board support: FST-01G
FST-01G is a new revision of original FST-01 with fixed pull-up of
D+ line.


* Major changes in Chopstx 0.12

  Released 2016-05-31

** Provide drivers of SYS, USB and ADC
Those were only offered as examples, but now, Chopstx provides drivers
of SYS, USB, and ADC.  Please note that the ADC driver is not for
general use (it's specific to NeuG to get noise).  To use them, enable
variables in Makefile, like following.
------------
CHIP=stm32f103
USE_ADC = yes
USE_USB = yes
USE_SYS = yes
DEFS  = -DUSE_SYS3 
------------

** Removal of chopstx_usec_wait_var chopstx_wakeup_usec_wait
This API was used when we need to wait something with timeout.
Now, we have better API with chopstx_poll.  Please use chopstx_poll
and chopstx_cond_signal.


* Major changes in Chopstx 0.11

  Released 2016-05-19

** New feature: polling
New function chopstx_poll is added to watch multiple condition
variables, threads' exit, or IRQ, simultaneously with timeout.

** Change API of eventflag
The initialization function eventflag_init only has an argument of EV.
An eventflag can be waited with timeout or can be waited with no
timeout, as caller like.  It is not determined at initialization time
now.  Besides, the eventflag can be waited by any threads.  Functions
to poll eventflag together with other events (cond, join, and IRQ) are
provided.

** Removal of the function chopstx_release_irq
IRQ is enabled only when a thread is blocked in polling.  When it (the
thread in polling) is canceled, IRQ is disabled.

** Removal of the function chopstx_main_init
It is removed because it's too special.  Please use
chopstx_setpriority instead.

** New function: chopstx_setpriority
This function is not recommended in general.  It is only added to
support the usage when main thread wants to change the schedule
priority after creating other threads.

** Function chopstx_intr_wait is deprecated
Use of chopstx_poll is recommended.

** FS-BB48: Kinetis L MCU
Support for FS-BB48 board with Kinetis L MCU is added.

** No HardFault at context switch on Cortex-M0
By its design, Chopstx does context switch holding the scheduler lock.
This is implemented with the feature of BASEPRI on Cortex-M3.  Because
Cortex-M0 doesn't have support of BASEPRI, the context switch (before
version 0.11) always caused HardFault exception.  Since Cortex-M0
doesn't have complex exception mechism of ICI/IT (which is supported
on Cortex-M3), it is actually possible to implement the context switch
in user mode.  This is done.

** New sys.c (3.0)
Don't touch NVIC in usb_lld_sys_init.


* Major changes in Chopstx 0.10

  Released 2015-09-15

** Thread cancellation bug fix
Thread cancellation didn't work well with 0.09 because
of initial configuration mistake.  It's fixed.

** Interrupt handler bug fix
Interrupt handler wasn't unregistered on exit well.
It's fixed.


* Major changes in Chopstx 0.09

  Released 2015-09-10

** New board support: Nitrokey-Start
It is contributed by Mateusz Zalega.

** Thread cancellation
Add new API: chopstx_setcancelstate.


* Major changes in Chopstx 0.08

  Released 2015-07-31

** New board support: ST Nucleo F103
It is contributed by Kenji Rikitake.

** New board support: ST Dongle
It is contributed by Kenji Rikitake.
It's the ST-Link/V2-1 part of ST Nucleo F103.


* Major changes in Chopstx 0.07

  Released 2015-07-15

** New Board macro definitions
Each board-*.h should have BOARD_ID and BOARD_NAME now.
FLASH_PAGE_SIZE and NEUG_ADC_SETTING2_* are deprecated.

** New sys.c (2.1)
Flash memory size is probed at runtime now.  System
service flash pages now include sys_board_id and sys_board_name.


* Major changes in Chopstx 0.06

  Released 2015-07-08

** New file: clk_gpio_init.c
To avoid duplication of code, clock and GPIO initialization code
is now in this file.

** New board support: STM32 Primer2
It is contributed by Kaz Kojima.

** New board support: CQ STARM
The old board which was "published" by CQ Publishing in 2008 is added.


* Major changes in Chopstx 0.05

  Released 2015-04-20, by NIIBE Yutaka

** New function: chopstx_main_init
chopstx_main_init is the function to change the schedule priority of
main thread.  This is useful to enter main loop after initialization
of other threads.

** The use of CHX_PRIO_MAIN
CHX_PRIO_MAIN is deprecated.  Instead, please use the function
chopstx_main_init.

** Cortex-M0 support
Cortex-M0 support has been added.

** New board support: Maple mini
It is contributed by Aidan Thornton.

** New board support: FSM-55 and STM32F0 Discovery
Those boards with STM32F0 (Cortex-M0) are now supported.


* Major changes in Chopstx 0.04

  Released 2014-12-10, by NIIBE Yutaka

** new board.h macros and sys.c in example
In board.h, RCC_APB2ENR_IOP_EN was renamed to RCC_ENR_IOP_EN and
RCC_APB2RSTR_IOP_RST was renamed to RCC_RSTR_IOP_RST.  Example sys.c
was changed accordingly.

** Bug fix of chopstx_wakeup_usec_wait
chopstx_usec_wait_var/chopstx_usec_wait won't be woken up
by chopstx_wakeup_usec_wait.  This is now fixed in 0.04.

** Board support STBee and STBee Mini
The board STBee and STBee Mini are now supported.


* Major changes in Chopstx 0.03

  Released 2013-11-08, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Bug fix of preemption
In the implementation of preemption, there was a bug which might cause
not to schedule proper thread.  This is because the routine preepmt
itself might be interrupted.  This is now fixed in 0.03.


* Major changes in Chopstx 0.02

  Released 2013-11-08, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Bug fix of priority
There was a severe bug about the configuraion of priority setting of
exceptions.  As we don't use any inter-lock between interrupts hander
and timer expiration handler, these priorities should be equal.  If
not, timer expiration handler might interrupt the execution of
interrupts handers.


* Major changes in Chopstx 0.01

  Released 2013-11-03, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Interrupt handling change
There was a bug in 0.00, which caused spurious interrupts.  Every
interrupt event caused two events.  Specifically, after valid
interrupt event (for the caller of chopstx_intr_wait), another
spurious event was always occurred.  This was fixed.

In the design of Chopstx, interrupt handling is done by a thread.
Lower level interrupt handler just accepts interrupt, disabling the
interrupt, and switchs the control to the thread.  It is the thread to
check the cause of interrupt, to process it, and to clear the cause.
Next call to chopstx_intr_wait will enable the interrupt again.

The bug was related to pending interrupt flag.  Pending interrupt flag
for a specific interrupt is set, on return from handler mode if the
cause is still active.  With traditional interrupt handling, lower
level interrupt handler processes it and clears the cause.  Thus,
pending interrupt flag is not set on return.

In Chopstx, pending interrupt flag was always set, because the control
goes from lower level interrupt handler (in handler mode) to a
interrupt handling thread which processes the interrupt.  In 0.01, new
internal routine chx_clr_intr is introduced, and pending interrupt
flag is cleared within chopstx_intr_wait after waked up.

For detail of interrupt operation, see the section B.3.4, Nested
Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC), in the ARM v7-M Architecture
Reference Manual.  The subsection, B3.4.1, Theory of operation,
explains how it works.


** gpio_init change
Now, gpi_init support AFIO mapping and another GPIO (GPIO_OTHER)
settings.
