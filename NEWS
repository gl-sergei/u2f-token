* Major changes in Chopstx 0.01

  Released 2013-11-03, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Interrupt handling change
There was a bug in 0.00, which caused spurious interrupts.  Every
interrupt event caused two events.  Specifically, after valid
interrupt event (for the caller of chopstx_intr_wait), another
spurious event was always occurred.  This was fixed.

In the design of Chopstx, interrupt handling is done by a thread.
Lower level interrupt handler just accepts interrupt, disabling the
interrupt, and switchs the control to the thread.  It is the thread to
check the cause of interrupt, to process it, and to clear the cause.
Next call to chopstx_intr_wait will enable the interrupt again.

The bug was related to pending interrupt flag.  Pending interrupt flag
for a specific interrupt is set, on return from handler mode if the
cause is still active.  With traditional interrupt handling, lower
level interrupt handler processes it and clears the cause.  Thus,
pending interrupt flag is not set on return.

In Chopstx, pending interrupt flag was always set, because the control
goes from lower level interrupt handler (in handler mode) to a
interrupt handling thread which processes the interrupt.  In 0.01, new
internal routine chx_clr_intr is introduced, and pending interrupt
flag is cleared within chopstx_intr_wait after waked up.

For detail of interrupt operation, see the section B.3.4, Nested
Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC), in the ARM v7-M Architecture
Reference Manual.  The subsection, B3.4.1, Theory of operation,
explains how it works.


** gpio_init change
Now, gpi_init support AFIO mapping and another GPIO (GPIO_OTHER)
settings.
