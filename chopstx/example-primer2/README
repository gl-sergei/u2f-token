Example for STM32 Primer2 by Kazmoto Kojima

It is taken from:

   http://www.rr.iij4u.or.jp/~kkojima/letschopstx.html

From the original tar archive, chopstx-logo.data is removed because
it's too big.

You can generate it by ImageMagick.

  $ convert ../chopstx.svg -depth 8 -flip \( +clone -channel B -fx R \) +swap -channel R -fx v.B -resize 128x160 -background white -compress none -flatten chopstx.ppm

  $ tail -n +4 chopstx.ppm | sed -e 's/ /, /g' > chopstx-logo.data


Since it was written for Chopstx 0.06, you would need to change a bit,
perhaps.
